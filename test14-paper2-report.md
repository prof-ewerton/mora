| Visualizações Orientadas a Objetivos | "Many of these inspiring applications take a visual approach. Yet, if visualizations are to have any effect beyond the initial ’wow’ factor, it would be useful to have more clarity on what the intended goal is and how to assess whether that goal is achieved."   |
| Infraestrutura técnica para aprendizagem analítica | "If we want to apply learning analytics at a broader scale, then it is imperative that we realize an infrastructure that can support the development of tools and services." |
| Recomendações de aprendizagem | "By collecting data about user behavior, learning analytics can also be mined for recommendations, of resources, activities or people [17]. In this way, we can turn the abundance of learning resources into an asset, by addressing ’l’embarras du choix’ that is at the core of ’the paradox of choice’ [29]." |
| Pesquisa baseada em dados sobre aprendizagem | "On a meta-level, learning analytics provides exciting opportunities to ground research on learning in data and to transform it from what is currently all too often a collection of opinions and impossible-to-falsify conceptualizations and theories [23]." |
