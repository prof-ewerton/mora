| **Concept** | **Context where the concept was found** |
|---|---|
| Automated Assessment | "In this paper, I presented a series of proof-of-concept studies for what I termed “multimodal learning analytics:” a set of techniques that can be used to collect multiple sources of data in high-frequency (video, logs, audio, gestures, biosensors), synchronize and code the data, and examine learning in realistic, ecologically valid, social, mixed-media learning environments." |
| Code updates | "Using this sequence of vectors, the progress of each student was compared over the course of the class, by comparing their sequence of updates on a given assignment to their sequence of updates on the previous assignments." |
| Construction competence | "A second important area for MMLA application is text mining. A variety of features can be extracted from text or transcripts, some of which I describe below." |
| Constructionism | "Instruction is typically student-centered, with teachers customizing instruction to student's interests while fading their role with less need for direct teacher authority." |
| Identity | "Students participated in a weeklong robotics workshop and, subsequently, in one-on-one interviews with a member of the teaching staff." |
| Interactive engagement | "These technique s include logs of computer activities, wearable cameras, wearab le sensors, biosensors (e.g., skin conductivity, heartbeat, and EEG), gesture sensing, infrared imaging, and eye tracking." |
| Learning Analytics | "New high-frequency data collection technologies and machine learning analysis techniques could offer new insights into learning, especially in tasks in which students have ample space to generate unique, personalized artifacts, such as a computer program, a robot, or a solution to an engineering challenge." |
| Learning Trajectories | "The data analyzed suggested three coding profiles" |
| Modality | "However, these techniques are still not popular in the field of learning analytics." |
| Multimodal Learning Analytics | "I propose that multimodal learning analytics  could coalesce these multiple techniques in order to evaluate complex cognitive abilities, especially in environments where the process or the outcome are unscripted." |
| Process | "Of particular interest to this study is the presence of several features that accurately predicted expertise based on certainty." |
| Self-sufficiency | "In this first example, I focus on students learning to program a computer using the NetLogo language." |
| Student centered learning | "Assessment and feedback is particularly difficult within those tasks, and has hampered many attempts to make them more prevalent in schools." |
| Unsupervised Classification | "The goal of the paper is to be a proof of concept of novel assessment techniques along several modes." |
| User experiences | "Learning analytics could offer new insights into students’ learning trajectories" |
| User Models | "Combining Unsupervised and Supervised Classification to Build User Models for Exploratory Learning Environments" |
| User proficiency | "A second analysis on the frequency of code compilation. Instead of expert/novice differences, the data showed that compilation frequency could be used as a proxy for how ‘stuck’ students were in the assignment." |
| Videos | "Data captured the movement of objects as students progressed through the task, while gesture data, which consisted of twelve upper-body parts, recorded the students’ actions." |
| Word counting | "Of particular interest is the contrast between cluster five and its peers." |
