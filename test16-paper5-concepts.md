| Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) | "Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide educators and students with a comprehensive snapshot of the learning domain. Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties." |
| Predictive Analytics | "In contrast, predictive analytics is forward looking. It provides forecasts about individual learners such as their probable performance in upcoming assignments and future grades on completion of a course. The integration of both predictive with descriptive analytics brings out richer insights, ultimately adding more value to LADs." |
| Descriptive Analytics | "Descriptive analytics tends to look backwards to capture trends that are drawn from digital footprints left behind by learners while interacting within virtual environments. Digital footprints can result from accessing various learning resources or by undertaking collaborative activities or other communication interactions (Delen & Demirkan, 2013)." |
| Early Warning System (EWS) | "Most importantly, personalized learner-centric metrics on LADs can enable a form of self-reflection that results in positive behavioral adjustments. Meanwhile, instructor-facing LADs can identify at-risk students especially through predictive analytics, enabling instructors to initiate various forms of interventions which increase the probability of attaining successful course outcomes (Greller & Drachsler, 2012; Yoo et al., 2015)." |
| Machine Learning | "We conclude by making recommendations for the design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project only relevant information." |
| Visualizações | "Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties." |
| Modelos Preditivos | "However, while all the reviewed LADs utilized predictive analytics, none provided model interpretability to explain how the model works overall, nor were there any instances of insights being directly communicated about model reasoning (such as how a particular student was predicted to have a given outcome) making it difficult to recommend a specific remediation or even to trust the system." |
| Interpretabilidade do Modelo | "However, while all the reviewed LADs utilized predictive analytics, none provided model interpretability to explain how the model works overall, nor were there any instances of insights being directly communicated about model reasoning (such as how a particular student was predicted to have a given outcome) making it difficult to recommend a specific remediation or even to trust the system." |
| Avaliação de Dashboards | "Our findings reveal that evaluation approaches to measure dashboard effectiveness were followed with variable rigor among the reviewed papers (see Table 1). Most of the studies did not mention any evaluation criteria nor conduct any evaluations." |
| Sistemas de Feedback para Alunos | "Most importantly, personalized learner-centric metrics on LADs can enable a form of self-reflection that results in positive behavioral adjustments. Meanwhile, instructor-facing LADs can identify at-risk students especially through predictive analytics, enabling instructors to initiate various forms of interventions which increase the probability of attaining successful course outcomes (Greller & Drachsler, 2012; Yoo et al., 2015)." |
