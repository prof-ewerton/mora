# TITLE: "Gamification and Learning Analytics to Improve Engagement in University Courses"  
## Concepts Table  
| Concept | Context where the concept was found |  
|-----------|----------|  
| **Gamification** | "Gamification is one of the most used techniques to improve active participation and engagement in different kinds of contexts... The research presented in this work aims at combining gamification techniques and learning analytics to improve the engagement in University courses." |  
| **Learning Analytics (LAs)** | "On the other hands, the learning analytics have been largely implemented in education in order to improve the assessment and the self-assessment of students, above all in e-learning settings... The Learning Analytics (LAs), i.e. the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, are very useful to meet this objective." |  
| **E-learning engagement** | "One of the main problems in using MOOCs and all kind of online courses is the engagement and motivation... This students’ failure is a problem also for the educational system. In this context, in order to mitigate this problem of online courses and activities, we propose to apply the gamification approach to improve the student’s active participation and engagement in online university course." |  
| **Learning Dashboard** | "The paper describes a model of gamification and a learning dashboard defined based on data in Moodle e-learning platform... VeeU2.0, a learning dashboard for Moodle, has been designed and developed to support assessment by both teachers and learners in e-learning courses." |  
| **Gamification mechanics (XP, badges, leaderboards)** | "Following the game mechanics, eXperience Points (XP) were defined... When the user reaches a certain amount of XP, it gains a new level... badges can be collected according to both the points gained and the levels reached... The leader board of the users shows all the users, for the selected university course, with the relative amount of XP gained and the level." |  
| **Student engagement metrics** | "The dashboard offers two points of views... From the student point of view, the visualized data can help the student’s self-assessment that could be pushed to improve her/his efforts in the learning process... The success rate of 95% could be considered a positive indication about the usability of the system." |
